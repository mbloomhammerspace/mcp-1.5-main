# Event Emission Console - Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… IMPLEMENTED & DEPLOYED  

## Summary

Successfully extended the MCP Control Center with a comprehensive Event Emission Console that displays real-time events from the Hammerspace MCP server, including the new PDF ingest workflow events.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced File Monitor (`src/inotify_monitor.py`)

**New Event Logging Features:**
- âœ… **PDF Ingest Success Events**: Logs when PDF ingest jobs are successfully created and deployed
- âœ… **PDF Ingest Failure Events**: Logs when PDF ingest job creation/deployment fails
- âœ… **Event Emission**: All events are written to the JSON log file for the Event Console
- âœ… **Return Status**: Methods now return success/failure status for proper event tracking

**New Methods Added:**
- `emit_pdf_ingest_event(file_path, success)` - Emits PDF ingest events to the log
- Enhanced `trigger_pdf_ingest_job()` - Returns success/failure status
- Enhanced `create_pdf_ingest_job()` - Returns success/failure status

### 2. Event Console Web Interface (`web_ui/templates/events.html`)

**Features:**
- âœ… **Real-time Event Display**: Shows all events from the MCP server
- âœ… **Event Filtering**: Filter by event type, file path, and other criteria
- âœ… **Auto-refresh**: Automatically refreshes every 5 seconds
- âœ… **Event Statistics**: Shows counts of different event types
- âœ… **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- âœ… **Event Details**: Displays comprehensive event information

**Event Types Supported:**
- `NEW_FILE` - New files detected and tagged
- `RETROACTIVE_TAG` - Existing files tagged retroactively
- `PDF_INGEST_SUCCESS` - PDF ingest jobs successfully created
- `PDF_INGEST_FAILURE` - PDF ingest jobs failed to create

### 3. Web UI Integration (`web_ui/app.py`)

**New Routes:**
- âœ… `/events` - Event Console page
- âœ… `/api/events` - API endpoint for event data

**API Features:**
- âœ… **Event Retrieval**: Gets events from the inotify.log file
- âœ… **Filtering**: Supports event type and file path filtering
- âœ… **Pagination**: Limits results (default 1000 events)
- âœ… **JSON Parsing**: Properly parses JSON events from log file
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 4. Navigation Integration (`web_ui/templates/index.html`)

**New Button:**
- âœ… **ðŸ“¡ Events Button**: Added to the main navigation bar
- âœ… **Styling**: Green color scheme to distinguish from other buttons
- âœ… **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing Monitor and Debug buttons

## Current Status

### âœ… Working Components:
- **Event Console Page**: Fully functional and accessible at `/events`
- **API Endpoint**: Successfully serving event data
- **Event Logging**: PDF ingest events are being logged
- **File Monitor**: Enhanced with event emission capabilities
- **Navigation**: Events button added to main interface

### ðŸ“Š Event Data Available:
- **Total Events**: 569+ events currently in the system
- **Event Types**: NEW_FILE, RETROACTIVE_TAG, PDF_INGEST_SUCCESS, PDF_INGEST_FAILURE
- **Real-time Updates**: Events are logged as they occur
- **Historical Data**: All past events are preserved and accessible

## How to Use

### Accessing the Event Console:
1. **Main Interface**: Click the "ðŸ“¡ Events" button on the main page
2. **Direct URL**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/events`
3. **API Access**: Use `http://localhost:5000/api/events` for programmatic access

### Event Console Features:
- **Filter Events**: Use the dropdown to filter by event type
- **Search Files**: Use the file path filter to find specific files
- **Auto-refresh**: Toggle automatic refresh on/off
- **Manual Refresh**: Click refresh button for immediate updates
- **Clear Events**: Clear the display (doesn't delete from log)
- **Copy Data**: Copy individual event data or file paths

### Event Types Explained:
- **NEW_FILE**: Files newly detected by the file monitor
- **RETROACTIVE_TAG**: Existing files that were tagged when the monitor started
- **PDF_INGEST_SUCCESS**: PDF files that successfully triggered ingest jobs
- **PDF_INGEST_FAILURE**: PDF files that failed to trigger ingest jobs

## Technical Details

### Event Data Structure:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-16T02:21:08.209822",
  "event_type": "PDF_INGEST_SUCCESS",
  "file_name": "document.pdf",
  "file_path": "/mnt/anvil/hub/document.pdf",
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "job_type": "pdf_ingest",
  "collection_name": "bulk_selected_pdfs",
  "ingest_time": "2025-10-16T02:21:08.209822"
}
```

### API Parameters:
- `limit`: Number of events to return (default: 1000)
- `event_type`: Filter by specific event type
- `file_pattern`: Filter by file path pattern

### Log File Location:
- **Path**: `/home/ubuntu/mcp-1.5-main/logs/inotify.log`
- **Format**: JSON lines (one event per line)
- **Rotation**: Managed by the file monitor service

## Integration with PDF Ingest Workflow

The Event Console now provides complete visibility into the PDF ingest workflow:

1. **File Detection**: See when PDF files are detected in `/mnt/anvil/hub`
2. **Job Creation**: Monitor PDF ingest job creation success/failure
3. **Error Tracking**: Identify and troubleshoot failed ingest jobs
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track the volume and timing of ingest operations

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `web_ui/templates/events.html` - Event Console interface
- `EVENT_CONSOLE_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
- `src/inotify_monitor.py` - Enhanced with event emission
- `web_ui/app.py` - Added `/events` route and `/api/events` endpoint
- `web_ui/templates/index.html` - Added Events navigation button

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Usage**: Watch the Event Console for PDF ingest events
2. **Test Workflow**: Drop PDF files into `/mnt/anvil/hub` to see events
3. **Troubleshoot**: Use the console to debug any ingest job issues
4. **Optimize**: Monitor event volume and adjust filtering as needed

The Event Emission Console is now fully operational and provides comprehensive visibility into all MCP server activities! ðŸŽ‰
